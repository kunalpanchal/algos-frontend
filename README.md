# Algos-Frontend

The frontend app is made with Angular 4.2 using @angular/cli 1.4.9

## Algo1 - Frequently occuring words in a file

The SPA has a single input field to enter the "number of entries that are to be retrieved" along with 2 options either to   
  * Retrieve the data realtime from the file and provide the result. [Get the output]
  * Retrieve the data from cached data using Redis. [Get the output faster with Redis]

Note : "Where" and "where" are treated as different. ie. The program is case-sensitive.
